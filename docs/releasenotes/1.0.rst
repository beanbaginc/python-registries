Registries 1.0
==============

**Release date:** July 30, 2024

Registries is a module for managing collections of objects, allowing for easy
registration, lookups, and access.

This is ideal for applications that need to manage abstract interfaces with
backend implementations, such as plugins, extensions, and other cases where
you'd employ a Registry Pattern.

Registries was built to help develop `Review Board`_, our premier code review
product from Beanbag_, and we're making it available for use in other
projects.


Features in 1.0
===============

* **Dynamic registration** and unregistration of items.
* **Flexible lookups** based on registered lookup attributes.
* **Thread-safety** to avoid conflicts with modifying a registry.
* **Extensibility** through pre/post hooks for registration, unregistration,
  initial population, and resetting of registries.
* **Python type hints** to ease development.
* **Built-in registries** for order-dependent items and wrapping around
  `Python Entry Points`_.
